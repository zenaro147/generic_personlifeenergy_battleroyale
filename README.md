# Person Life Energy Battle Royale game
* Game Engine: Unity 5.6.5f1 (or/and maybe 2017.4.2f2/2017.1.2p3)
* Why this engine/version: It's compatible with all my current consoles (New 3DS, PsVita and WiiU). Also work with portable consoles gives me a good code experience.
* Objective: Make a game mechanic that's mimic a popular Japanese cartoon, where the player have a physical manifestation of his Life energy, giving the user super-powers and use this power in battle. Now apply some Battle Royale game mechanics.
